---WEATHER APP & ITS ARCHITECTURE---
- This small project is to develop my understanding of API calls in a web application.
- Information like temperature, wind speed and humidity are fetched and displayed to the user as per the user input
- This project contains 3 files and script.js contains the API logic handling
- The icons in the weather card are in the images folder
- index.html has the basic template of the information which is then later managed by DOM.
- style.css has all the properties to give the look and feel of the application.


---LOGIC---
- There are 2 API calls/urls being used from a free weather app (www.openweathermap.org)
- apiUrl1 is for coordinate conversion of the user input city
- apiUrl2 is for weather details to display to the user.


---BUGS---
- none so far
